    # FlightRadar GraphQL API Documentation

    This API provides real-time and historical aircraft position data for flight tracking and analysis.

    ## Basic Usage
    To query data, use the root `Query` object. You can:
    - Fetch the latest aircraft positions with a `limit`
    - Filter aircraft data by ICAO code (aircraft identifier)
    - Filter aircraft data by flight number (callsign)

    ## Example Query
    ```graphql
    query {
      aircraftPositions(limit: 5) {
        flight
        latitude
        longitude
        altitude
        timestamp
      }
    }
    ```
